# does the start class only query for information?
# does it take an argument?
# what if it takes turn as an argument?
# what will it do with a turn?

# it can ask a turn to get retvals
# get symbols for hash table lookup in terminal
# get info about who won the game
# who lost the game / out of cards

# what logic happens here?
# does this class know about turn_n ?
